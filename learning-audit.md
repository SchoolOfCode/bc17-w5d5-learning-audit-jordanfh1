1. HTML JS Events

Objective: Understand and effectively use JavaScript events to create dynamic web pages.

Action Steps

1. Learn the Basics of JavaScript Events:
     - Read and understand the basics of JavaScript events (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`, `onchange`).
     - Resources: MDN Web Docs, W3Schools.
   
2. Practice with Simple Examples:
     - Create small projects to handle basic events like button clicks and form submissions.
     - Use online platforms like CodePen or JSFiddle to experiment.
   
3. Advanced Event Handling:
     - Learn about event delegation and propagation.
     - Implement more complex event-driven features like drag-and-drop, real-time form validation, and interactive lists.
     - Resources: Tutorials on JavaScript.info, Eloquent JavaScript (Chapter on Events).

4. Build a Project:
     - Develop a small interactive web application (e.g., a to-do list, a quiz app) to apply and test your understanding of events.

2. Interactions with a Database through `app.js`

Objective: Master CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) by interacting with a database through a Node.js application.

Action Steps:

1. Set Up Environment:
     - Install Node.js and Express.js.
     - Set up a simple Express server in an `app.js` file.

2. Learn Basics of Databases:
     - Understand relational (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational (e.g., MongoDB) databases.
     - Resources: MDN Web Docs, MongoDB University, SQLZoo.
   
3. Connect to a Database:
     - Learn how to connect your Node.js app to a database.
     - Practice with both SQL (using libraries like Sequelize) and NoSQL (using Mongoose for MongoDB).

4. Implement CRUD Operations
     - Create routes in your `app.js` file to handle CRUD operations.
     - Test your endpoints using tools like Postman.
     - Resources: Official documentation of Sequelize and Mongoose, various Node.js tutorials.

5. Build a Full-stack Project:
   - Week 6-7:
     - Develop a full-stack application (e.g., a blog, a task manager) that performs CRUD operations through `app.js`.
     - Incorporate user authentication and authorization for a more complete project.

 Evaluation:
- Week 8: Deploy your project on a platform like Heroku or Vercel, and gather feedback from users.

 3. RESTful APIs

Objective: Gain proficiency in designing, implementing, and consuming RESTful APIs.

 Action Steps:

1. Understand REST Principles:
     - Learn the fundamentals of REST architecture and its constraints.
     - Resources: RESTful Web Services by Richardson and Ruby, tutorials on REST API design.

2. Design RESTful APIs:
     - Practice designing APIs by defining endpoints, methods, and data structures.
     - Use tools like Swagger or Postman for API documentation and testing.

3. Build RESTful APIs:
     - Implement your API design in a Node.js application using Express.js.
     - Ensure proper error handling, validation, and security measures (e.g., JWT for authentication).

4. Consume RESTful APIs:
     - Learn to make API requests from a client-side application using Fetch API or Axios.
     - Create a simple frontend (e.g., using React) that interacts with your RESTful API.

5. Advanced Features:
     - Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting in your API.
     - Handle file uploads and downloads through your API.

 General Tips:

- Stay Consistent: Dedicate specific hours each week to learning and practicing.
- Seek Feedback: Regularly review your code with more experienced developers.
- Stay Updated: Follow tech blogs, and YouTube channels, and subscribe to newsletters for the latest trends and best practices.
